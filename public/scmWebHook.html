#** Lab 10: SCM Web Hooks**
OpenShift offers several mechanisms to trigger the automatic deployment of
applications. In this Lab, we will demonstrate the deployment of a very simple
application via a GitHub Web Hook trigger.

## Part I

In Part I of the Lab we will:

- Create a new project.
- Deploy an application using a source to image strategy.
- Create a route to expose the newly deployed application.

**Step 1: Create new project**

**Remember** to substitute the UserName

```
oc new-project scm-web-hooks-UserName --display-name="Test WebHooks"
```

**Step 2: Create new application**

- We will use the forked repository from the previous lab.

**Remember** to substitute the UserName


```
oc new-app --image=php --code=https://github.com/GitUserName/bluegreen.git --name=scm-web-hooks
```

**Step 3: Look at some of the created resources**

- Build configuration

```
oc get bc
```

- Deployment configuration

```
oc get dc
```

- Show created service

```
oc get service
```

- Show replication controller

```
oc get rc
```

- Show route

```
oc get route
```

Notice that there is no route created yet for this application.

- Show the builds in progress (Running)

```
oc get builds
NAME              TYPE      STATUS    POD
scm-web-hooks-1   Source    Running   scm-web-hooks-1-build
```

- Monitor the build

```
oc build-logs scm-web-hooks-1
or
oc logs build/scm-web-hooks-1
```

The build should finish with a line similar to:

*Successfully pushed 172.30.120.13:5000/scm-web-hooks/scm-web-hooks:latest*

**Step 4: Create a route**

```
oc get service
NAME            CLUSTER_IP      EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)    SELECTOR                                           AGE
scm-web-hooks   172.30.214.33   <none>        8080/TCP   app=scm-web-hooks,deploymentconfig=scm-web-hooks   9m

**Remember** to substitute the UserName

oc expose service scm-web-hooks --hostname=scm-web-hooks.UserName.apps.devday.sc.osecloud.com
NAME            HOST/PORT                                               PATH       SERVICE         LABELS              TLS TERMINATION
scm-web-hooks   scm-web-hooks.UserName.apps.devday.sc.osecloud.com      scm-web-hooks   app=scm-web-hooks   
```
**Step 5: Test the application**

- Use the newly created route, in the above case
scm-web-hooks.aquiroga.apps.devday.sc.osecloud.com and paste it in your browser.

- You should see:

![Webhook](./green_deployment)

## Part II

At this point you have an application with one single replica running inside a
docker container in OpenShift. We used the source retrieved from the git repository
and layered it using a builder or image stream strategy; in this particula case,
the php image 
stream.

In this part of the Lab we will:

- Create a web hook for the recently deployed application.
- Make a small change to the application.
- Test to make sure the application was re-deployed.

**Step 1: Retrieve the OpenShift Web Hook URL**

- Navigate to the OpenShift Web console and login.
- Click on your project, browse and then builds.
- Click onto the build name from the list of bui You should have just one in this case.
- Click Configuration tab and click `Show URL` for the GitHub link.
- Copy the GitHub Web Hook URL. You will need this URL for next step.

![Webhook](./github_show_url)

**Step 2: Configure GitHub repository Web Hook**

- Login to your GitHub account.
- Navigate to the forked repository you used to create the application.
- Click on Settings.
- Click on Webhooks and Services
- Click on the "Add webhook" button.
- Add the recently copied Web Hook URL from OpenShift.
- Click on the "Disable SSL Verification" button.
- Confirm by adding the "Add Webhook" button in green at the bottom of the page.- 

![Webhook](./github_add_webhook)

**Step 3: Redeploy the application**

- Edit in your GitHub account the image.php file.
- One of the lines in line 9 or 10 should be commented out. Make a change so that
the line that was previously commented out becomes active and pound the other one.
- Commit the file.

**Step 4: Monitor new deployment process**

- After saving/committing the image.php file with the small change, you'll notice
in the OpenShift Web Console that a new build process has been automatically 
triggered. **You didn't have to start a build yourself.**
- Monitor the build process using:

```
oc get builds

oc logs build/the-new-build-process-name
```

## Summary

We have shown in this Lab how simple it is to configure automatic deployments
of applications using OpenShift and GitHub Web Hook triggers. It should be noted
that OpenShift also supports Generic Web Hooks.
