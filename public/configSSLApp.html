#** Lab 8: Using SSL in your Application**
In this exercise you will set up your application to encrypt traffic with the OpenShift Wildcard certificate

**Step 1: Switch to an existing project**

For this exercise, we will use an application that we created before. We will be using the `myjbossapp-UserName` that you created in the previous labs. Make sure you are switched to that project by using the `oc project` command. **Remember** to substitute UserName

```
$ oc project myjbossapp-UserName
```

**Step 2: View the routing config**

To view the routing config you will need to use the `oc get route` command

```
$ oc get route/ks -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2015-12-22T03:56:30Z
  labels:
    app: ks
  name: ks
  namespace: myjbossapp-shchan
  resourceVersion: "2903142"
  selfLink: /oapi/v1/namespaces/myjbossapp-shchan/routes/ks
  uid: fba5d1e6-a85f-11e5-be21-fa163ec58dad
spec:
  host: ks-myjbossapp-UserName√ü.apps.devday.sc.osecloud.com
  port:
    targetPort: "8080"
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: ks
status: {}
```

Note here that the `host:` is set to the FQDN that your application is running on. 

Currently the routing component of OpenShift 3 supports ports 80 and 443. When you first create your route, the mapping of 80 to your pod is done automatically. There are a few things that need to be done in order to get the 443 mapping to work.

**Step 3: TLS Edge Termination**

OpenShift has a "wildcard" SSL certificate that it can use for any application. We can use this SSL certificate to serve SSL from our application without having to generate a cert of our own (which is sometimes called SSL-offloading).

Edit your routing configuration

```
oc edit route/ks -o yaml
```

You are going to add `tls: termination: edge` right below the `host:` section. It should look something like this.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2015-12-22T03:56:30Z
  labels:
    app: ks
  name: ks
  namespace: myjbossapp-shchan
  resourceVersion: "2903142"
  selfLink: /oapi/v1/namespaces/myjbossapp-shchan/routes/ks
  uid: fba5d1e6-a85f-11e5-be21-fa163ec58dad
spec:
  host: ks-myjbossapp-userXX.apps.devday.sc.osecloud.com
  tls:
    termination: edge
  port:
    targetPort: "8080"
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: ks
status: {}
```

**Step 4: Verify**

Verify by visiting your page by using the `https://ks-myjbossapp-userXX.apps.devday.sc.osecloud.com`
You now need the `s` in https now.


Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about service SSL from your application
