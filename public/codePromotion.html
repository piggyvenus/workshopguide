#** Lab 12: Code Promotion Across Environments**
In this lab we will learn how an application binary can be promoted across the environments. As as example we will use development and QA environments as promotion to Pre-prod and Production will be very similar.

In this example we are using projects as means of separation of environments (development, qa, production).

**Step 1: Create two projects**

Using the knowledge you gained from the past create two projects. Name them "development-UserName" and "testing-UserName". **Remember** to substitute the username.

**Step 2: Provide ImagePuller Access to the QA Project from Development Project**

The following command will allow the QA project to be able to pull the docker images from the Development project.

````
oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:testing-UserName -n development-UserName
````

**Step 3: Create an application in the development project**

Switch over to the "development-UserName" project and deploy an application using eap6-basic-sti template. You can use webconsole or command line. The command line option is shown below.

*Bonus points:* Clone this application to your own github account and deploy it so that you can redeploy with changes later.

````
oc project development-UserName
oc new-app --template=eap64-basic-s2i -p APPLICATION_NAME=myapp,SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/kitchensink.git,CONTEXT_DIR=,SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF= -l name=myapp
````

**Step 4: Tag the docker image**

Wait until the application gets built and deployed. Now if you check the imagestreams you will find the docker image for this application.

Now find the imagestream name using the following command. "is" is the short form for imagestream.

````
$ oc get is
NAME      DOCKER REPO                                   TAGS      UPDATED
myapp     172.30.47.239:5000/development-UserName/myapp   latest    12 seconds ago

````

Now describe this image stream to get the full image id and repeat the command until you see the Tag Spec shows as below.


````
$ oc describe is myapp
Name:               myapp
Created:            13 minutes ago
Labels:             application=myapp,name=myapp,template=eap64-basic-s2i,xpaas=1.1.0
Annotations:        openshift.io/generated-by=OpenShiftNewApp
                    openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=tag "latest" has not been set on                   repository "development-UserName/myapp"
Docker Pull Spec:   172.30.226.0:5000/development-UserName/myapp

Tag Spec        Created     PullSpec                                                        Image
latest  <pushed>    9 minutes ago   172.30.226.0:5000/development-UserName/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4    
````
You can watch the build by doing the following:

````
$oc get builds
$oc logs build/myapp-1

````


In this case, the full image Id is ':pdevelopment-UserName/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4'

Now let us assume that this docker image is good and is ready to promote to QA. Let us tag this docker image using the `oc tag` command.

The format is 

````
oc tag FullImageId development-UserName/myapp:promote-qa
````



```
oc tag development-UserName/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4 development-UserName/myapp:promote-qa

oc describe is myapp
Name:               myapp
Created:            16 minutes ago
Labels:             application=myapp,name=myapp,template=eap64-basic-s2i,xpaas=1.1.0
Annotations:        openshift.io/generated-by=OpenShiftNewApp
                    openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=tag "latest" has not been set on repository "development-UserName/myapp"
Docker Pull Spec:   172.30.226.0:5000/development-UserName/myapp

Tag     Spec                                        Created     PullSpec                                            Image
latest      <pushed>                                    12 minutes ago  172.30.226.0:5000/development-UserName/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4    
promote-qa  myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4   58 seconds ago  172.30.226.0:5000/development-UserName/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4

```
**Step 5: Deploy the application to QA**


Now you can switch over to the QA project and deploy the docker image that we tagged in development. Also expose service to create route for this project.
**Remember** to substitute username

````
oc project testing-UserName
oc new-app development-UserName/myapp:promote-qa
oc expose service myapp
````

Test this application in the QA project. Note that we deployed the docker image from the development project without rebuilding the code

**Bonus points**: Make changes to your git repo ( to src/main/webapp/index.xhtml)and deploy it to development first. Notice that your changes are seen only in development project. Repeat the changes a couple of times. Now find the latest imagestream and tag it as promote-qa. Watch out that the QA project gets redeployed when you update the new tag.

Watch this [video](https://blog.openshift.com/promoting-applications-across-environments) for complete understanding. 

Congratulations!! you now know how to promote your application across environments in OpenShift 3.
